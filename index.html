                Biking, also known as cycling, is the activity of riding a bicycle. It involves pedaling to propel the bike forward, using the power of your legs. Biking can be done for various purposes, including recreation, transportation, exercise, and sport. It can take place on various surfaces such as paved roads, trails, mountains, or dirt tracks, depending on the type of biking.
                <br><br>
                The bicycle itself consists of a frame, two wheels, pedals, handlebars, and a seat. The rider sits on the seat and uses the pedals to move the bike forward while steering with the handlebars. Different types of bikes are designed for specific purposes, such as road bikes for speed, mountain bikes for rough terrain, or hybrid bikes for a combination of both.

            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is a recreational air sport and a form of free-flight that involves flying a lightweight, non-motorized glider known as a paraglider. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a large, fabric wing that resembles a parachute.
                <br><br>
                To launch, the pilot runs to generate enough lift, allowing the wing to catch the wind and lift the pilot into the air. Once airborne, the pilot can control the flight by adjusting the brakes attached to the wing, allowing for turns, altitude changes, and speed control.Paragliding is typically done from hills or mountains, where natural wind currents provide lift. It offers a unique, peaceful flying experience with a direct connection to the environment, as the pilot is entirely dependent on the wind and weather conditions.

            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a water sport in which an individual rides on the face of a wave, typically on a surfboard. The goal is to ride the wave as it breaks and moves toward the shore, maintaining balance and control. Surfers use the natural energy of the wave to propel themselves forward, executing maneuvers such as turns, carving, and sometimes even jumping or performing tricks
                <br><br>
                Surfing is often done in ocean waves but can also take place in artificial wave pools. The surfboard is typically made of lightweight materials like foam or fiberglass, and surfers use their body movements to control the board's speed and direction. Surfers paddle out to where the waves break, wait for the right wave, and then paddle to catch it.
